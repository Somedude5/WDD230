          <em><h2>Our History</h2></em>
          <p>
            Bountiful Foods was founded in the picturesque town of Greenhaven in
            1992 by a group of close-knit friends, Amelia, Benjamin, and
            Charlotte. Their shared love for nature and a deep appreciation for
            the bountiful fruits grown in the region inspired them to establish
            a business that would bring the freshest and finest fruits to their
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting out as a humble roadside fruit stand, Bountiful Foods
            quickly gained popularity for its exceptional quality and friendly
            service. Customers would flock to our stand, eager to savor the
            mouthwatering flavors of our freshly picked fruits. As word spread
            and demand grew, we realized that we had an opportunity to make a
            more significant impact on people's lives.

            id="card-img"
          />
          <p>
            Embracing this vision, Bountiful Foods expanded its operations to
            collaborate directly with local farmers who shared our commitment to
            sustainable and organic farming practices. By sourcing our fruits
            locally, we ensure that each bite is packed with the authentic
            flavors of our region and supports the hardworking farmers who
            nurture the land.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, Bountiful Foods has grown into a beloved institution
            in Greenhaven, known for its delectable assortment of fruits and its
            dedication to the community. We have extended our reach to supply

            businesses, allowing us to make a positive impact on the entire
            region.
